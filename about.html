            <h3>About Charlottesville Alliance FC</h3>
            <p>Charlottesville Alliance FC joined the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) in 2018.  Cville Alliance FC is a non-profit organization with a mission to build a community through a nationally recognized soccer team. Community, diversity and fun are the core values of the organization. The roots of CAFC were planted when the team, formally named Aromas Café FC, made a highly successful run in the 2014/15 U.S. Open Cup. The team was made up of players from more than 10 different countries, a reflection of the rich diversity of the Charlottesville community. The team expanded this experience to extensive community outreach and served as a soccer team with a social conscience. They have purchased soccer goals for in-need communities, mentored youth, played charity games, conducted free clinics, and even played soccer with youth at the local detention center. Cville Alliance FC is led by Executive Director David Deaton and a core staff that include local professionals, business owners, and ex-collegiate and professional soccer players.</p>
