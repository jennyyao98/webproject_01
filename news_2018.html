          <a href="">Welcome to NPSL:  Charlottesville Alliance FC
</a>
<p>There are pickup teams, there are local rec teams, and there are pub  teams in soccer.  Now in Charlottesville, Virginia, there is a  restaurant team turned 501c3, joining the NPSL as the Charlottesville  Alliance FC.  After making an impressive 2016 US Open Cup run against  the Richmond Kickers, Cville FC has rebranded from Aromas Cafe FC (named  after their primary sponsors), and taken their game to the next level.    Our editor Jason Bruzzichesi was able to sit down with David Deaton of  the newly christened team, and talk a little bit more about their club.</p>
