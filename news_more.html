        <h2>Charlottesville Alliance FC Appoints Head Coach for Inaugural NPSL Season</h2>
        <h3><i>Longwood University’s Jon Atkinson to lead Alliance in 2018
</i></h3>
        <p>Charlottesville Alliance FC is proud to announce that Jon Atkinson has been named head coach for the 2018 Season. Atkinson brings expertise from his long coaching career at Longwood University where he has been the head coach for twelve seasons and was chosen as the Big South Coach of the Year in 2013. Prior to his appointment to head at Longwood in 2005, Atkinson spent two seasons as an assistant for the Lancers.  Atkinson holds a US Soccer Coaching A License and serves on the Board of Directors for the Thunder FC soccer program in Farmville, Virginia. Atkinson is a native of Newcastle, England and played professionally at Sunderland and Darlington FC.  Atkinson will be accompanied at Alliance FC by his Longwood assistant coach, Sam Avery, who has served as Atkinson’s assistant for the past 3 years.

“Firstly I want to thank the board at Charlottesville alliance for trusting me to spearhead their inaugural campaign. I am humbled and honored to take the reins and do what I can to do to ensure we have a successful campaign. I knew from the first meeting that this is a special club with special people involved and for me that was imperative as relationships spark energy and enthusiasm throughout which will translate on the field and within the community” says Jon.


Jason Fargo, a Longwood University soccer alum, who serves as Director of Soccer Operations for the Alliance says of Atkinson, “Jon has a great mind for the game and will bring a wealth of knowledge to our players and organization with his coaching and playing experiences.  I am very excited to have such a quality coach and person who is dedicated to growing the game in Charlottesville and the US on the Alliance staff.  He embodies our philosophies and vision as well as our motto - United by Soccer.  We are looking forward to having a successful season with Jon at the helm.”


Atkinson has two Bachelor's degrees from English universities and an MBA from West Virginia Wesleyan. He is married to Nikki, and together they have one daughter and three sons.


The Alliance management is excited to bring a veteran head coach with deep Virginia ties on board for its inaugural season.
